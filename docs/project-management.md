### Issue types
## Storie / Epic: new functionalities, improvements
Name must be something like: As a [User] I want to [be able to do that task] so that [I can achieve that specific goal ]
It should be user-centered, short, specific and goal-oriented.
This task should always contain at least:
* a design/thinking/conception/estimating phase where everybody can (should?) participate, 
* a “do it” phase: all the subtasks have been listed and are now taken care of,
* a test phase

## Bug: functional problem 
Must contain steps to reproduce (can be a video) and expected result/behavior

## Visual problem
Must contain at least one image and expected behavior


### Tasks Categories
## Urgent / Product is broken / (UX)Utility is broken: 
* User cannot create an account, 
* User cannot login, 
* User cannot submit payments,
* Payments not being processed, 
* …

## Semi-Urgent /  / (UX)Usability is broken: 
* Navigation problems, 
* Consistency problems, 
* Visual clarity problems,
* Errors prevention,
* Flexibility and efficiency,
* Irritating for the users, 
* Feedback from users,
* ...

## Not Urgent / Needs to be fixed someday and Nice To Have / (UX)Desirability and Brand Experience:
Everything that doesn’t go in the other two categories


### Meetings
Every week: planning meeting to re/estimating the new tasks and/or the ones being handled this week and make sure everybody agrees on the numbers.
Everyday (in mail or metting):
* is the task a problem: taking more time than anticipated, missing something from somebody, ..., should it be pushed to the next sprint?
* is the task taking less time: why
* is everything going well
