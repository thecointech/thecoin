          "text": "This project is our most current carbon offset. We settled for it due to its combined climate change and social impacts. Implemented in Uganda, Kenya, and Tanzania, the project focuses on biogas, a renewable form of energy. Biogas is produced by the decomposition of animal and plant waste in an oxygen-starved environment and is used as an alternative to fuel and natural gas. The anaerobic digestion that occurs in oxygen-deficient environments breaks down the waste into methane and carbon dioxide. I know! You are probably wondering how biogas reduces climate change, yet it releases carbon dioxide and methane, which are both greenhouse gasses, into the atmosphere.  ",

However, please note that plants, which are responsible for fixing carbon into the soil are the primary source of biogas. So, any emissions from the plant waste are essentially carbon neutral. That is why plants and trees are not considered sources of emissions despite releasing carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Their net carbon emission contribution is zero since they fix and release carbon into the atmosphere in equal measure. This point is the primary difference between biogas and fossil fuels. While biogas comes from plants that remove carbon dioxide and methane from the atmosphere, fossil fuels do not remove emissions at all. They only contribute. ",

Like wind and solar power, biogas can be continuously generated from plant and animal waste. So long as plants and animals exist, they will always release waste, which can be digested into biogas. This is why they are considered a renewable source of energy. Renewable energy sources have a net positive effect on emission reduction compared to nonrenewable sources such as fossil fuels. I hope you now get the point.  If you don’t, you will get it by the time you are done reading this article. ",

Instead, they cut down living trees, which would otherwise remove carbon from the atmosphere. Unlike in the case of biogas, which relies on natural plant or animal waste, effectively being carbon neutral, cutting down trees removes their carbon elimination potential. Worse off, instead of letting the cut down trees decompose into natural waste, they burn them into charcoal, a process that releases carbon monoxide into the atmosphere. ",

First, trees that would otherwise remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere have been cut down, leading to more carbon in the environment. Secondly, the cut-down trees are converted to charcoal, a process that releases even more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Thirdly, charcoal as a source of fuel releases more greenhouse gasses. Compare that to using biogas, which relies on natural waste only, making it carbon neutral. Biogas is also renewable as plant wastes occur naturally. See why we invested in this offset. By allowing charcoal users in these countries to use biogas instead of charcoal, we have prevented huge volumes of carbon dioxide from entering the atmosphere. ",

Our choice of this offset is informed by its tangible contribution to different facets of climate change, including transitioning from fossils to renewable energy sources and providing a sustainable source of emission avoidance. More importantly, the project is aligned to four Sustainable Development Goals that serve as concrete proof of its impact on the environment. In that regard, the project contributes to SDG 13 focused on climate action, SDG 7 on affordable and clean energy, SDG 8 on decent work and economic growth, and SDG 6 on clean water and sanitation. On SDG 13, the project stopped 131,241 tons of carbon dioxide, 36.3 tons of carbon monoxide, and 7.7 tons of Non-methane Volatile Organic Compounds (NVOC) from being released into the atmosphere. As for SDG 7 and 8, the project prevented the importation of 23,294 cubic meters of natural gas into Turkey and ensured social contribution by employing locals from the project area. Safety and Health training conducted in the project contributed to SDG 8. Lastly, on SDG 6, the project ensured that 4,912 cubic meters of wastewater discharge were avoided. ",

Wind energy reduces pressure on other nonrenewable energy sources such as fossil fuels. The reduced pressure eventually translates to reduced consumption of these harmful energy sources. Remember, nonrenewable energy sources are the most significant contributors to greenhouse emissions. Thus, by reducing their consumption, we will have effectively reduced their negative impact on climate change. This reduction allows for the replenishment of natural resources such as plants and animals that would otherwise be adversely affected by the heavy presence of greenhouse emissions in the atmosphere.",

The social impacts of wind projects such as creating local employment and promoting environmentally friendly practices are also worth noting. After all, the main objective of combating climate change is to improve the quality of human life by promoting sustainable co-existence between people and our environment. ",
