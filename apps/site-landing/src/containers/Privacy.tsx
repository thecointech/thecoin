    <br />1. Website Visitors
    <br />
    <br />Like most website operators, TheCoin Collaborative Canada collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. TheCoin Collaborative Canada's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how TheCoin Collaborative Canada's visitors use its website. From time to time, TheCoin Collaborative Canada may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.
    <br />
    <br />TheCoin Collaborative Canada also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on https://thecoin.io blog posts. TheCoin Collaborative Canada only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below.
