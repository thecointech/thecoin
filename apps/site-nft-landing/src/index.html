          Climate change has been increasing at an alarming rate in the recent past. In fact, the extreme weather
          phenomena we're experiencing is a deafening wakeup call that we must work towards carbon neutrality, quickly.
          The buck stops here. With us. And with you.

          time you stake your claim, make your mark and inspire the rest.

          Climate change is a problem that affects us all. Every one of us needs to move towards carbon neutrality as
          quickly as possible.
        </p>
        <p class='smaller'>
          Unfortunately, this isn't happening. Even though it's so important, there isn't any personal gain for an
          individual to make this effort. The cost is personal, and in the scope of the problem, the sacrifice seems
          meaningless. There has to be a solution that compensates the right action.
        </p>
        <p class='larger'>
          We believe we have found a pathway for individuals to reach carbon-neutrality that is rewarding. Individuals
          don't need to wait for the government to step up and force us to change, or for corporations to put
          philanthropy over profit. TheGreenNFT is the first step on the path. It is one way we can make it better for
          us to be carbon-neutral - making what we should do, what we want to do .
        </p>
        <p class='smaller'>
          Once being carbon-neutral makes you better off, will the climate crisis still be a crisis?
        </p>

          P.S. We are a registered NPO in Canada, and every dollar raised is put towards reducing CO2 emissions.
